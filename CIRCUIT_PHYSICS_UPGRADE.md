# Circuit Physics Engine Upgrade

## Overview
Complete physics overhaul for the Kirchhoff Circuit Simulator with proper implementation of electrical laws and realistic component behavior.

## ✅ What Was Fixed

### 1. **Proper Kirchhoff's Laws Implementation**

#### **Before (Incorrect):**
- Only handled simple series circuits
- No detection of parallel components
- Assumed all components in series
- Wrong current/voltage distribution

#### **After (Correct):**
- **Kirchhoff's Current Law (KCL)**: ΣI_in = ΣI_out at every node
- **Kirchhoff's Voltage Law (KVL)**: ΣV_loop = 0 for each circuit loop
- Proper nodal analysis with node-voltage mapping
- Accurate topology detection (series/parallel/mixed)

---

### 2. **Series Circuit Physics** ✅

**Physical Law:**
- Same current flows through all components: `I₁ = I₂ = I₃ = I_total`
- Voltage drops add up to source voltage: `V_source = V₁ + V₂ + V₃`
- Total resistance: `R_total = R₁ + R₂ + R₃ + ...`
- Each voltage drop: `V_n = I × R_n`

**Implementation:**
```typescript
// Series resistance calculation
equivalentResistance = resistiveElements.reduce((sum, elem) => {
  return sum + this.getComponentResistance(elem.component);
}, 0);

// Total current (Ohm's Law)
totalCurrent = totalVoltage / equivalentResistance;

// Each component gets same current
newComp.current = totalCurrent;
newComp.voltage = totalCurrent * resistance; // V = I × R
```

---

### 3. **Parallel Circuit Physics** ✅

**Physical Law:**
- Same voltage across all parallel components: `V₁ = V₂ = V₃ = V_parallel`
- Current splits inversely proportional to resistance: `I_n = V / R_n`
- Total current is sum of branch currents: `I_total = I₁ + I₂ + I₃`
- Equivalent resistance: `1/R_total = 1/R₁ + 1/R₂ + 1/R₃ + ...`

**Implementation:**
```typescript
// Parallel resistance calculation
let sumOfInverses = 0;
groupResistances.forEach((R: number) => {
  if (R > 0) sumOfInverses += 1 / R;
});
const equivalentR = 1 / sumOfInverses;

// Same voltage across parallel components
const parallelVoltage = totalCurrent * equivalentR;

// Current splits by resistance
const componentCurrent = parallelVoltage / componentResistance;
```

---

### 4. **Component-Specific Physics** ✅

#### **Resistor**
- Follows Ohm's Law: `V = I × R`
- Power dissipation: `P = I²R = V²/R`
- Overload detection: `P > 0.25W` (typical rating)
- Visual feedback: Turns RED when overloaded

#### **Bulb (Light Bulb)**
- Acts as resistor with resistance R
- Brightness proportional to power: `Brightness = P_actual / P_rated`
- Power calculation: `P = I²R`
- Rated power: 6W (typical 12V, 0.5A bulb)
- Instant glow when current flows (realistic behavior)

#### **Battery**
- Maintains constant voltage (ideal voltage source)
- Supplies current based on circuit load: `I = V_source / R_total`
- Small internal resistance: 0.01Ω (negligible)

#### **Switch**
- **Closed (ON)**: Nearly zero resistance (0.001Ω) - current flows
- **Open (OFF)**: Very high resistance (1e9Ω) - no current
- Visual angle: 0° = closed, 45° = open

#### **Capacitor**
- DC steady-state: Acts as open circuit (infinite resistance)
- Charge storage: `Q = C × V`
- Voltage-dependent charge accumulation

#### **Inductor**
- DC steady-state: Acts as short circuit (very low resistance)
- Opposes current changes: `V = L × dI/dt`

### 5. **Circuit Topology Detection** ✅

**Algorithm:**
1. Build node-connection map
2. Analyze each node:
   - **2 connections**: Series components
   - **>2 connections**: Parallel components
3. Classify circuit: `series`, `parallel`, or `mixed`
4. Apply appropriate solving method

**Example:**
```
Series: Battery → Switch → Resistor → Bulb → Battery
Parallel: Battery → (R₁ || R₂ || R₃) → Battery
Mixed: Battery → R₁ → (R₂ || R₃) → R₄ → Battery
```

---

### 6. **Accurate Power Calculations** ✅

**Three equivalent formulas:**
- `P = I × V` (Power = Current × Voltage)
- `P = I²R` (Power = Current² × Resistance)
- `P = V²/R` (Power = Voltage² / Resistance)

**Used for:**
- Bulb brightness calculation
- Resistor overload detection
- Energy dissipation analysis

## 🔬 Physics Validation Examples

### **Example 1: Series Circuit**
**Circuit:** 24V Battery → 10Ω Bulb → 5Ω Resistor

**Calculations:**
```
R_total = 10Ω + 5Ω = 15Ω
I = V/R = 24V / 15Ω = 1.6A

Bulb:
  V_bulb = I × R = 1.6A × 10Ω = 16V
  P_bulb = I²R = (1.6A)² × 10Ω = 25.6W

Resistor:
  V_resistor = 1.6A × 5Ω = 8V
  P_resistor = (1.6A)² × 5Ω = 12.8W
  OVERLOADED! (P > 0.25W max)
```

**Result:**
- Current: 1.6A through all components ✓
- Voltage check: 16V + 8V = 24V ✓
- Resistor turns RED (overload) ✓
- Bulb brightness: 25.6W / 6W = 100% (full bright) ✓

---

### **Example 2: Parallel Circuit**
**Circuit:** 12V Battery → (6Ω Bulb || 12Ω Resistor)

**Calculations:**
```
1/R_eq = 1/6Ω + 1/12Ω = 2/12 + 1/12 = 3/12
R_eq = 4Ω

I_total = V/R_eq = 12V / 4Ω = 3A

Branch currents:
  I_bulb = V/R = 12V / 6Ω = 2A
  I_resistor = 12V / 12Ω = 1A
  
Check: 2A + 1A = 3A ✓ (KCL satisfied)

Power:
  P_bulb = I²R = (2A)² × 6Ω = 24W
  P_resistor = (1A)² × 12Ω = 12W
```

**Result:**
- Same voltage (12V) across both ✓
- Current splits: 2A + 1A = 3A ✓
- Lower resistance (bulb) gets more current ✓
- Bulb brightness: 24W / 6W = 100% ✓

R = V / I
```
