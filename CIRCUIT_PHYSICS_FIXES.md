# Circuit Physics Fixes - Accurate Electrical Logic

## Issues Fixed

### 1. **Circuit Status Logic** âœ…
**Problem:** Circuit showed "CIRCUIT INACTIVE" but lamp was glowing at 100%
**Solution:** 
- Fixed `isRunning` logic to properly detect circuit state
- Circuit is INACTIVE when switch is open OR no battery
- Circuit is ACTIVE when switch is closed AND current flows

### 2. **Bulb Brightness Physics** âœ…
**Problem:** Bulb brightness wasn't based on realistic physics
**Solution:**
- **Power-based brightness**: `Brightness = P_actual / P_rated`
- **Typical bulb**: 6W rated power
- **Realistic calculation**: `P = IÂ²R` (Power = CurrentÂ² Ã— Resistance)
- **Instant response**: No delays, immediate on/off

### 3. **Series Circuit Calculations** âœ…
**Problem:** Complex impedance calculations were wrong for simple series circuits
**Solution:**
- **Simple series formula**: `R_total = R1 + R2 + R3 + ...`
- **Ohm's Law**: `I = V / R_total`
- **Same current** through all components in series
- **Voltage drops**: `V_n = I Ã— R_n`

### 4. **Resistor Overload Detection** âœ…
**Problem:** Overload detection wasn't accurate
**Solution:**
- **Triple protection**: Current, Voltage, AND Power limits
- **Current limit**: 100mA (0.1A)
- **Voltage limit**: 50V
- **Power limit**: 0.25W (P = IÂ²R)
- **Visual feedback**: Turns RED when ANY limit exceeded

## Physics Formulas Used

### **Ohm's Law**
```
V = I Ã— R
I = V / R
R = V / I
```

### **Power Calculations**
```
P = V Ã— I
P = IÂ²R
P = VÂ²/R
```

### **Series Circuit**
```
R_total = R1 + R2 + R3 + ...
I_total = V_source / R_total
V_n = I_total Ã— R_n
```

### **Bulb Brightness**
```
P_bulb = IÂ² Ã— R_bulb
Brightness = P_actual / P_rated
```

### **Resistor Overload**
```
P_resistor = IÂ² Ã— R_resistor
Overload = (I > 0.1A) OR (V > 50V) OR (P > 0.25W)
```

## Component Behavior

### **ðŸ”‹ Battery**
- Maintains constant voltage
- Supplies current based on total circuit resistance
- Visual: 3D gradient with +/âˆ’ terminals

### **ðŸ”€ Switch**
- **Closed (ON)**: Current flows, circuit active
- **Open (OFF)**: No current, circuit inactive
- Visual: Mechanical lever with LED status

### **ðŸ’¡ Bulb/Lamp**
- Acts as resistor with resistance R
- Brightness = Power / Rated Power (6W typical)
- Visual: Multi-layer glow with glass dome and filament

### **ðŸ”Œ Resistor**
- Follows Ohm's Law: V = I Ã— R
- Overload when P > 0.25W OR I > 0.1A OR V > 50V
- Visual: Color bands, turns RED when overloaded

### **ðŸ”‹ Capacitor**
- DC analysis: Acts as open circuit (infinite resistance)
- Visual: Cylindrical with polarity markings

### **ðŸŒ€ Inductor**
- DC steady-state: Acts as short circuit (low resistance)
- Visual: Coiled wire with magnetic core

## Test Cases

### **Test 1: Switch OFF**
- **Expected**: Circuit INACTIVE, lamp OFF, resistor normal
- **Result**: âœ… All components turn off instantly

### **Test 2: Switch ON**
- **Expected**: Circuit ACTIVE, lamp glows, resistor may overload
- **Result**: âœ… Proper current flow and visual feedback

### **Test 3: High Voltage (29V)**
- **Expected**: Resistor overloads (turns RED), lamp bright
- **Result**: âœ… Resistor shows "OVERLOAD", lamp glows at high brightness

### **Test 4: Low Voltage (12V)**
- **Expected**: Normal operation, no overload
- **Result**: âœ… Resistor shows "OK", lamp glows normally
